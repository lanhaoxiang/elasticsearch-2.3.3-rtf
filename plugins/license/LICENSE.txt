excluded but may be limited, Sections 4.1 and 4.2 do not apply to that liability and instead Elasticsearch’s liability
for such failure is limited (at Elasticsearch’s election) to, in the case of a supply of goods, the Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch supplying the services again or paying the cost of having the services supplied again.
